4. Search for **"RAPT Brewing Session Manager"**
5. The integration will **automatically discover** your RAPT Pill via Bluetooth
6. Select your device from the list or enter manually if not found
7. Click **Submit** to complete setup

### Bluetooth Setup
- Ensure your RAPT Pill is powered on and transmitting
- The device should be within Bluetooth range of your Home Assistant instance
- If not automatically discovered, you can enter the device MAC address manually

## Usage

### Starting Your First Session
1. Use the "Start New Session" button (automatically stops any existing session)
2. Session automatically created with timestamp name (e.g., "Brew 2025-01-17 18:30")
3. Customize session name using the Session Name text input
4. Set brewing parameters using number inputs:
   - **Original Gravity**: Starting gravity (auto-detected from first reading)
   - **Target Gravity**: Expected final gravity
   - **Target Temperature**: Ideal fermentation temperature

### Monitoring Progress
- **Real-time Readings**: Current gravity, temperature, battery level
- **Calculated Metrics**: ABV%, attenuation%, fermentation rate
- **Historical Charts**: Gravity and temperature trends over time
- **Alert System**: Automatic alerts for stuck fermentation, temperature issues, and low battery

### Session Controls
- **Single Session Focus**: One active session at a time for simplicity
- **Session Naming**: Customize session names during brewing
- **Target Setting**: Set original gravity, target gravity, and target temperature

## Dashboard Configuration

The integration provides a comprehensive brewing dashboard with real-time monitoring:

The dashboard shows:
- **Session Control**: Start/stop sessions, edit names, and delete sessions
- **Gravity Readings**: Raw and temperature-corrected gravity values
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Current and target temperatures
- **Fermentation Progress**: Alcohol percentage, attenuation, and fermentation activity
- **Device Status**: Battery level, signal strength, and connection status
- **Alerts**: Active alerts with clear button
- **Historical Charts**: Gravity trends over time showing fermentation progress

### Notification Configuration
Alerts automatically create Home Assistant persistent notifications in the UI. For external notifications:

#### ‚úÖ Built-in Notification Service (Recommended - Easy!)
First, ensure you have a notification service configured (mobile app, Telegram, email, etc.). Then:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **RAPT Brewing Session Manager**
2. Click **Configure**
3. Select your notification service from the dropdown (e.g., `notify.mobile_app_your_phone`)
4. Click **Submit**

**Done!** The integration automatically sends alerts to your chosen notification service with rich data including alert type, session name, and brewing status.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Integration won't load**
- Verify Bluetooth is enabled on your Home Assistant server
- Check that your RAPT Pill is broadcasting (manufacturer IDs 16722 or 17739)
- Review Home Assistant logs for errors

**No data updates**
- Ensure RAPT Pill is powered on and broadcasting BLE advertisements
- Check Bluetooth range (ESPHome BLE proxies recommended for better range)
- Verify integration is receiving BLE advertisements in logs

**Incorrect calculations**
- Confirm original gravity is set correctly
- Check target gravity values
- Ensure sufficient data points for rate calculations
